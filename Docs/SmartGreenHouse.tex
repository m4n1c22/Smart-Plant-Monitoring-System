Plant monitoring is seen as one of the most important tasks in any farming or agriculture based environment. With the inception of Ambient Intelligent systems, there have been a rise in ambient intelligent based devices - Smart Homes~\cite{ref001} and other similar technologies involving RFID has evolved over the past few years~\cite{ref002}. Integration of such an ambient intelligent system with plant monitoring makes farming easier. In this paper, we discuss about the implementation of a smart plant monitoring system which makes use of the concept ambient intelligence with the use of .Net Gadgeteer which proactively handles the plant monitoring system. The given implementation works along with a cloud based server and a mobile based device (ideally Android/iOS device) which helps the user to control and see the status of the plant which being monitored by the hardware device. The given circuitry detects changes in the moisture, temperature and light conditions in and around the plant, and performs a machine based curation on the plant by providing necessary irrigation and illumination for the plant. Machine curation is also integrated with active weather forecasting systems which are deployed in the cloud based server using which advanced machine curation is performed. For user based curation, the Android device provides user an option to override a machine curated operation. %conclusion statement to be added...
